dtree
-------------

A simple command-line tool to display the dependency tree of on single file using 'require()' to require external modules. 

To install: 

```
npm install -g dtree (sudo may be required).
```

To use, just type:

```
dtree <path to your file>
```

dtree will draw out your dependency tree to the command line, and also log any modules that failed to load or any circular dependencies that may exist.
